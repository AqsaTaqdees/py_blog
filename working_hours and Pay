Write a program which takes the following 3 inputs from the user. * No. of hours spent working * Has the person worked on a weekend (Y/N)? (For HW) * Days per weekend spent working? (For HW)

Usually, a person normally spends 40 hours at work per week (5 days) and gets paid5𝑝𝑒𝑟ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟.𝐴𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑓8ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠.𝐼𝑓𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑁𝑜.𝑜𝑓ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛40,𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑑ℎ𝑒/𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑠10 per hour for the extra hours.
